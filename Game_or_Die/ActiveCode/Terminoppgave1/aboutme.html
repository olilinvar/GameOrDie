          <h4>Hi! My name is Oliver Lindtein.</h4>
          I am a 16-year-old boy living in Oslo with my mother, father, little sister, little
          brother, two rabbits and a hamster. I was born in Beijing, China in
          2006. I moved to Norway when I was 7 years old and have lived here
          since. I went to an elementary school (Smestad Skole) that I
          attended for 6 years before changing to a private school (Oslo
          Montessoriskole) to spend my last year in elementary school as well
          as finishing middle school and eventually starting in high school
          here at Kuben which I am writing this very sentence at. I am very
          interested in computers, software, networks, coding and more. I am
          eager to learn more about these fields. My dream is to work with
          either cybersecurity, AI, or space exploration. When it comes to my
          pros and cons, I sometimes have a difficult time with staying on
          task as I zone out on occasion, but on the other hand once something
          is within my field of interest, I suddenly become hyper focused with
          a high working speed while being creative and a little over the top
          engaged. I am great at reading people and I have an excellent social
          understanding but at the same time I dislike being social in long
          periods. I am great at adapting to my environment including the
          people and I constantly put others needs above mine. I have a strong
          sense of morality and justice. If I see someone being treated
          unfairly, I act and fight for what I think is right. My biggest
          weakness is being terrible at consistently sticking to routines but
          it as something I want to improve on and I am very dedicated to doing
          so.
